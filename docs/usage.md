# Usage

In order to use Mentat, a bot account must first be created on Discord and invited to the server you want to use for your engagement. This can be done by following the guide at: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

After installing, invoke the bot by simply running:

```bash
mentat
```

The Discord bot token should be available within your current directory in a file called `config.yml` or specified via `--path` when invoking the Mentat CLI.
